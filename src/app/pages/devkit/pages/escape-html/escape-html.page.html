  <h2>Why escape HTML?</h2>
  <p>
    Escaping HTML is essential to prevent unintended behaviors caused by special characters in strings. Characters like
    <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, <code>&quot;</code>, and others, if left unescaped, can be interpreted as
    HTML, which could lead to rendering issues or potential security risks, such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.

  <h2>Using the <code>escapeHTML</code> pipe</h2>
  <p>
    The <code>escapeHTML</code> pipe offers a convenient way to sanitize HTML content within Angular templates,
    converting special characters to their HTML-safe equivalents.
  </p>
  <p>
    By using this pipe, characters such as <code>&amp;</code>, <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;</code>,
    <code>&quot;</code>, and <code>&#39;</code> are automatically converted to their HTML entities, making the content
    safe for display in the DOM.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <code>escapeHTML</code> pipe is particularly helpful when displaying user-generated content, such as usernames,
    comments, or any other inputs from external sources, ensuring that these strings render as text rather than HTML. To
    use the <code>escapeHTML</code> pipe in your template, simply apply it to any string binding where HTML escaping is
    needed.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Note:</strong> escaping HTML is not needed when the text will be used with

  <h2>Programmatic usage</h2>
  <p>
    For programmatic use outside of templates, the <code>escapeHTML</code> function offers the same HTML-escaping
    functionality, converting characters directly in code where template pipes aren't available.
