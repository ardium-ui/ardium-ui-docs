<app-introduction pageTitle="Throttled Signal">
  <p>
    The <strong>Throttled Signal</strong> restricts how often its value can be updated, enforcing a minimum delay between changes.
    This helps control performance and rate limits in high-frequency scenarios.
  </p>
  <p>
    Only the latest value within each throttle window is applied, making it suitable for handling scroll, resize, or mouse movement events.
  </p>

  <p>
    The signal requires an initial value and a throttle interval (ms). Updates are allowed at most once per interval.
    Intermediate updates are ignored unless they are the last before the interval ends.
  </p>
  <p>
    The applied throttle time is accessible through the read-only <code>throttleTime</code> property.
