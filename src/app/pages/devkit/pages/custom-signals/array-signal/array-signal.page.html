<app-introduction pageTitle="Array Signal">
  <p>
    The <strong>Array Signal</strong> is a reactive, mutable signal tailored for working with arrays in Angular. It
    provides a suite of familiar JavaScript array methods with reactivity baked in, enabling seamless updates across the
    application.

  <app-h2>Array signal methods</app-h2>
  <p>
    The writable array signal includes methods such as <code>push()</code>, <code>pop()</code>, <code>map()</code>,
    <code>filter()</code>, <code>splice()</code>, <code>setAt()</code>, and <code>updateAt()</code> that modify the
    array by replacing it with a new cloned version. This ensures optimal signal reactivity without mutating the
    original reference.
  </p>
  <p>
    Every method triggers Angular's reactivity engine, including methods that would normally not change the array, like
    <code>map()</code> or <code>filter()</code>. Those methods update the signal's value as well, and cannot be chained
    like standard array methods.

    For a list of all methods, go to the Api tab.

  <app-h2>Read-only array signal</app-h2>
  <p>
    The <code>asReadonly()</code> method creates a non-writable version of the array signal. This version disables all
    mutation methods while retaining access to properties like <code>isEmpty</code>, ensuring safe and consistent usage
    where mutations are not allowed.
