  <p>
    The <strong>Debounced Signal</strong> delays updates to its value, applying them only after a specified period of inactivity.
    This is useful for reducing excessive signal updates in response to rapid input changes.
  </p>
  <p>
    It ensures only the latest value is set after the debounce time elapses, making it ideal for user input or search filtering.

  <p>
    The signal takes an initial value and debounce time (ms). Updates are held and applied only if no new change occurs within that time.
  </p>
  <p>
    The debounce interval can be checked using the read-only <code>debounceTime</code> property.
