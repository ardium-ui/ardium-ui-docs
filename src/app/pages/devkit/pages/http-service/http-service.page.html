<app-introduction pageTitle="HTTP Service">
  <p>
    An extension of the native <a href="https://angular.dev/api/common/http/HttpClient"><code>HttpClient</code></a> with
    support for default options and with extended type safety.

  <h2>Usage</h2>
  <p>
    <code>HttpService</code> should be used exactly the same as the native <code>HttpClient</code>. All the same methods
    are available, but <code>POST</code>, <code>PUT</code>, and <code>PATCH</code> methods now support specifying the
    request body type through a type parameter.
  </p>
  <p>
    The main reason to use <code>HttpService</code> over <code>HttpClient</code> is the ability to specify the API url
    that should be prepended to every request, which is not easily possible with the native client.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is how HttpService can improve code:
