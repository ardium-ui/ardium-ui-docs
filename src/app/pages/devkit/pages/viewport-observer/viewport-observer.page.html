<app-introduction pageTitle="Viewport Observer">
  <p>
    The <strong>Viewport Observer</strong> tracks element visibility within the viewport. It listens for scroll events
    on a specified host element and notifies registered observers when elements enter or leave the viewport.
  </p>
  <p>
    Observers can be registered by passing an element, searching by ID, or using a query selector. The observer can be
    configured with margin and throttling options for fine-tuned behavior.
  </p>

<section>
  <app-h2>About Viewport Observers</app-h2>
  <p>
    Viewport observers track an element’s position relative to the viewport, specifically whether the element is inside
    or outside it.
  </p>
  <p>Use the Viewport Observer service to register new observers:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>observeElement</code> — observes a given <code>HTMLElement</code> or <code>ElementRef</code></li>
    <li><code>observeById</code> — observes the first element with the provided ID</li>
    <li><code>observeByQuery</code> — observes the first element matching the provided CSS selector</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    These methods should be called after the view element is initialized. The service doesn’t check for this
    automatically. All methods return an <code>ArdViewportObserverRef</code> instance, which exposes further reactive
    options.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <app-h2>Using <code>ArdViewportObserverRef</code></app-h2>
  <p>
    The <code>ArdViewportObserverRef</code> class represents an individual viewport observer instance. It has a
    <code>viewportRelation</code> property, which returns the current viewport relation. Possible values include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>ViewportRelation.Above</code> — element is fully above the viewport.</li>
    <li><code>ViewportRelation.PartiallyAbove</code> — element is partially above, partially inside the viewport.</li>
    <li><code>ViewportRelation.Inside</code> — element is fully inside the viewport.</li>
    <li><code>ViewportRelation.PartiallyBelow</code> — element is partially below, partially inside the viewport.</li>
    <li><code>ViewportRelation.Below</code> — element is fully below the viewport.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Additionally, there are two special relations:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>ViewportRelation.InsideButTooLarge</code> — element is too large to fit entirely within the viewport.</li>
    <li>
      <code>ViewportRelation.Undefined</code> — element's position hasn't been checked yet (only immediately after
      creating the observer).
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    There is a shorthand signal <code>isInViewport</code>, which returns <code>true</code> if the element is at least
    partially within the viewport.
  </p>

  <app-h3>When are values updated?</app-h3>
  <p>
    The service updates all registered observers when the page is scrolled or the window is resized. By default, it
    listens for scroll events on the <code>document</code> element. This can be changed using the
    <code>setScrollHost</code> method, which takes an <code>HTMLElement</code>. This change is only necessary if the
    <code>document</code> is unscrollable, as it may produce incorrect results.
  </p>
  <p>
    To manually update all observer values, use the <code>recheckAll()</code> method. Alternatively, use the
    <code>recheck()</code> method on individual observers.
  </p>

  <app-h3>Destroying an Observer</app-h3>
  <p>
    To stop an observer from reacting to events, use the <code>destroy()</code> method on its reference. The
    <code>isDestroyed</code> signal indicates whether the ref has been destroyed.
  </p>
  <p>When the service is destroyed, all registered observers are automatically destroyed.</p>

  <app-h2>Further Configuration</app-h2>

  <app-h3>Margins</app-h3>
  <p>
    Margins define how close an element must be to the viewport to be considered visible. They can be specified as a
    single value or separate values for top and bottom. Positive values shrink the viewport (elements may still be
    visible, but treated as outside the viewport). Negative values extend the viewport beyond the visible area.
  </p>
  <p>
    Margins can be set when registering the listener, through the optional options object, or updated later using the
    observer ref methods.
  </p>

  <app-h3>Throttling</app-h3>
  <p>
    Throttling limits how often scroll events are processed, improving performance when dealing with multiple observers.
    By default, throttling is set to 100 ms.
  </p>
  <p>Throttling is configured during listener registration using the options object.</p>
