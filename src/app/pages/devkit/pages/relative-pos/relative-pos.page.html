  <p>
    The <strong>EventRelativePos</strong> class calculates the relative position of a pointer event
    (mouse or touch) within an HTML element. It determines whether the event overflows beyond
    the element’s boundaries and provides an easy-to-use interface for accessing this data.

  <p>
    The class computes the relative position of an event based on its coordinates in relation to an element’s
    bounding rectangle. The result is represented with the <code>top</code>, <code>right</code>,
    <code>bottom</code>, and <code>left</code> properties, which indicate how far the event occurred from
    each respective edge of the element.
  </p>
  <p>
    Additionally, boolean properties such as <code>overflowsTop</code> or <code>overflowsRight</code> indicate
    whether the event is outside the element’s boundaries in a specific direction.
  </p>
  <p>
    The overflow properties provide insight into whether an event is outside the element's boundaries.
    The <code>overflows</code> property is a combined check that returns <code>true</code> if the event
    position extends beyond any of the four edges.
