<app-introduction pageTitle="Form Field">
  <p>
    Form fields are wrappers that provide structure and context to form controls such as input fields and select
    dropdowns. They enhance the user experience by grouping related elements together, ensuring consistent styling, and
    providing accessibility features.

  <app-h2>Form Field Building Blocks</app-h2>
  <p>Form fields are composed of several key elements that work together to create a cohesive user experience:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <code>&lt;ard-label&gt;</code> - a text element that describes the purpose of the form control. It is placed
      either above or beside the input field.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>FormControl</strong> - the actual form control where users enter or select data. This can be any supported
      component listed below. It is required for every form field.
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>&lt;ard-hint&gt;</code> - additional information or instructions that assist users in filling out the form
      control correctly. This text is displayed below the input field. When an error is present, all hints are replaced
      with errors.
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>&lt;ard-error&gt;</code> - a message that should be used when the user enters invalid data or leaves a
      required field empty. It provides feedback on what needs to be corrected. If used, it replaces all displayed
      hints.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Those elements can be mixed-and-matched together in any order inside of the form field elements. Only the
    FormControl is required, all other elements are optional.
  </p>
  <app-h3>Supported FormControl Components</app-h3>
  <p>Currently those components are supported by the form field:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Native HTML <code>input</code>, <code>select</code>, and <code>textarea</code> elements</li>
    <li><a routerLink="/components/input">Input</a></li>
    <li><a routerLink="/components/autocomplete-input">Autocomplete Input</a></li>
    <li><a routerLink="/components/select">Select</a></li>
    <li><a routerLink="/components/number-input">Number Input</a></li>
    <li><a routerLink="/components/date-input">Date Input</a></li>
    <li><a routerLink="/components/digit-input">Digit Input</a></li>
    <li><a routerLink="/components/file-input">File Input</a></li>
    <li><a routerLink="/components/password-input">Password Input</a></li>
    <li><a routerLink="/components/hex-input">Hex Input</a></li>
    <li><a routerLink="/components/segment">Segment</a></li>
    <li><a routerLink="/components/radio-group">Radio Group</a></li>
    <li><a routerLink="/components/calendar">Calendar</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    All other components will result in an error being thrown because the form field is not able to access the data it
    requires from the component.
  </p>
  <p>
    Any custom component, however, can be made compatible with form field if the component implements the
    <code>ArdFormFieldControl</code> interface, and if it is provided to the
    <code>ARD_FORM_FIELD_CONTROL</code> injection token. Example of such component can be seen below:
  </p>

<section>
  <app-h2>Labels</app-h2>
  <p>
    Labels are used to, well, label the form control inside of the form field. They provide important accessibility and
    quality of life functionality to the form. Labels are automatically linked to the form control by its id (either
    provided or auto-generated), and allow for clicking on the label to focus the form control.
  </p>
  <p>
    Labels, additionally, can be marked as either required or optional, depending on the approach. By default, labels
    marked as required will display a red asterisk at the end, while those marked as optional will display "(optional)"
    at the end. Those texts can be customized through the <code>requiredText</code> and
    <code>optionalText</code> attributes, or by <a href="#providing-default-values">providing default values</a> for the
    form field.

<section>
  <app-h2>Hints And Errors</app-h2>
  <p>
    Hints and errors can be used to aid the user in completing the form. Hints are usually used to convey some kind of
    message to the user about this particular form field, or to help input the correct data, such as by displaying the
    date format or a character counter.
  </p>
  <p>
    Errors are usually used to alert the user about a problem with the form field. When errors are displayed, all
    existing hints will be hidden.
  </p>
  <p>
    Both hints and errors are available as components or directives, and can be used interchangably. Which one will be
    used depends entirely on the use case, but in most cases it is easier to use the component.
  </p>
  <p>
    Hints and errors can be aligned either to the left or the right of the form control using the <code>left</code> or
    <code>right</code> attributes on them. More so, multiple hints or errors can be used in a single form field, and
    multiple of them can be aligned to the same side - they will be displayed in a column.
  </p>
  <p>
    When error elements are present, only them will be displayed and all hints will be hidden. If a hint should be
    displayed alongside errors, use <code>&lt;ard-hint-error&gt;</code> - a special element that is displayed in both
    cases. Keep in mind that errors have priority over hints and will be displayed first in a column. This behavior,
    however, can be changed with CSS.
  </p>
  <p>
    Below is an example implementation of a passport number field, which takes 9 alphanumeric characters. For ease of
    use, the field has a character counter built-in.
  </p>
  <app-code-example [data]="FormFieldCharacterCounterExampleData" heading="Form field with a character counter" />

  <app-h3>Multiple errors</app-h3>
  <p>
    One form field can display multiple error messages, both on the left and on the right. In most cases multiple errors
    will be displayed using multiple <code>&#64;if</code> blocks and no issues will arise. However, due to how Angular
    content projection works, one <code>&#64;if</code> block can only have a single projectable node at its root.
    Because of that, if multiple errors need to be returned from a single <code>&#64;if</code> block, wrap them all in
    an <code>&lt;ng-container&gt;</code> and add the <code>ard-error</code> attribute to it (or
    <code>ard-hint</code> for hints). This problem normally doesn't happen, as in most cases a single
    <code>&#64;if</code> block only returns a single error.
  </p>

  <app-h3>Hint & error directives</app-h3>
  <p>
    Hints and errors can also be applied to other elements using the <code>ArdiumHintDirective</code> and the
    <code>ArdiumErrorDirective</code> (also <code>ArdiumHintErrorDirective</code>). The directive needs to be imported
    separately, as they are all standalone, and the attributes <code>ard-hint</code> or <code>ard-error</code> need to
    be applied to the custom element.
  </p>

  <app-h2>Providing default values</app-h2>
  <p>
    Default values of all form field properties can be provided using the <code>provideFormFieldDefaults</code> provider
    function. It takes an object of new default values, and returns a provider token.
  </p>
  <p>
    It can also be used to provide default values for the label element, namely the <code>[requiredText]</code> and
    <code>[optionalText]</code> properties.
  </p>
